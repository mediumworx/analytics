    "This is part one of three part series on how to create a forecast, using one of the most widely used data science tool - Excel. If you are suprised by this statement then we refer you to www.kdnuggets.com (one of the most widely followed blog for data science).  They conduct annual poll on tools and according to the poll, Excel is one of the most widely used tool by data scientists (https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/05/poll-tools-analytics-data-science-machine-learning-results.html). If you have a question about using Excel, just ask any data scientist in your organization. They are most likely to be Excel expert and they will probably will be able to assist you.\n",

    "Forecasting is the process of making predictions of the future based on past and present data and most commonly by analysis of trends.  The accuracy of forecast decreases as you stretch out your forecast. For example, if you are forecasting monthly sales then accuracy of forecast for month 1 sales of forecast will be higher than month 2 sales of forecast and so on. One of my co-worker likes to state that best way to predict tomorrow's weather is to assume it is similiar to today's weather. Everything else is just a guess."
