    "Forecasting is the process of making predictions of the future based on past and present data and most commonly by analysis of trends.  The accuracy of forecast decreases as you stretch out your forecast. For example, if you are forecasting monthly sales then accuracy of forecast for month 1 sales of forecast will be higher than month 2 sales of forecast and so on. One of my co-worker likes to state that best way to predict tomorrow's weather is to assume it is similar to today's weather. Everything else is just a guess.\n",

    "    - [x] Python (Anaconda Python is preferred choice, which can be downloaded from here => https://www.anaconda.com/download/)\n",
    "    - [x] Basic knowledge Python (You really do not need to be expert in python to use python for data science tasks. Many data scientists supplement their basic knowledge of python with google :-) to complete their tasks. We will provide a tutorial soon...)\n",
    "    - [x] Basic knowledge Jupyter Notebook/Lab (Good news is that Jupyter Notebook/Lab is easy to use and learn. We will provide a tutorial soon...)\n",
    "    - [x] Basic knowledge Pandas (Pandas is data analysis tool for the Python programming language. This is one of the tool where more you know will make your job easier and there is always google :-). We will provide a tutorial soon...)\n",
    "    - [x] Basic knowledge statistical data visualization tool, such as matplotlib, seaborn, bokeh, or plotly (These are data visualization tool for the Python programming language. These are a set of the tool where more you know will make your job easier and there is always google :-). We will provide a tutorial soon...)\n",
    "    - [x] Historical data with same frequency (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly, etc.), to create a forecast. This is important since you cannot create a forecast without historical data that does not have same frequency. If your data does not follow same frequency, then aggregate your data so it will be same frequency. For example, if your data consists of any random two days per week then aggregate (i.e., sum up those two days) your data into a weekly data then create a forecast using aggregated data."
